# MiniCalculator
Midterm Section C

Create a program that multiplies, divides, and returns the total value given a specified input.

The unit tests test the multiply and divide methods using positive and negative values, and the multiply method is tested with a zero value as well. If the variable "total" has the expected value given the scenario, then the test is a success. Otherwise, the test is a fail.
